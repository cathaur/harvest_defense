***CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS***

Intended description of the scenario, when it is done:

This is a scenario for MegaGlest.  It uses the Megapack techtree.

This scenario known to work with MegaGlest version 3.9.1 on GNU/Linux.
It probably also works on other operating systems, but the author
hasn't tested them.

The goal of this scenario is to have a bunch of resources stored
(10000 gold, 7500 stone, 7500 wood) as fast as possible.  You need
these resources in order to build the Intangible MacGuffin (which does
not actually exist, but pretend that it does).

At the same time, however, you will be attacked by enemies, so you
will have to spend resources on defenses; the difficulty of the enemy
attacks is dependent on the number of workers you have.  Thus, as you
get more workers, the game is more difficult.  The difficulty also
increases over time.
